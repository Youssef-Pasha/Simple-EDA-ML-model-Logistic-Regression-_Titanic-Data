# Simple-EDA-ML-model-Logistic-Regression-_Titanic-Data
# Overview
This project is from kaggle competitions, and the task is to build a predictive model that answers the question: “what sorts of people were more likely to survive?” using passenger data (ie name, age, gender, socio-economic class, etc).
# Dataset
The data has been split into two groups:
 > training set (train.csv)
   The training set should be used to build machine learning models.
 > test set (test.csv)
   The test set should be used to see how well  model performs on unseen data.
 # output
 A csv file (name: submission.csv) with exactly 418 entries plus a header row.
 The file should have exactly 2 columns:
   > PassengerId.
   > Survived.
 # Technologies Used
 Python
